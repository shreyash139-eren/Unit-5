"In the Game model, we are storing a reference to the Publisher. Explain the benefits of this 'referencing' strategy. What potential problems or inefficiencies might arise if we chose to embed the entire publisher document inside every game document instead?"

So, by adding reference of the publisher in game we can access all the information stored for that refrence. In refrence we store the _id of that document provided by mongo and by using .populate() we can get all the informations stored in that document and the benefit ih this refrencing is that the code remains readable and clean, and by using refrencing its also easy for someone new to understand what's going on, whereas if we stored the whole document inside other than the code becomes less readable and not that clean.
